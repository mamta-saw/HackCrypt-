# HackCrypt – Hackathon Preliminary Round

This repository is created for the **HackCrypt Hackathon – Preliminary Round(Conceptual only)**.

## About
The preliminary round focuses on **problem understanding, analysis, and solution ideation** based on the theme provided by the organizers.

**Theme:** EnvironmentTech – Community Waste Reporting

⚠️ *Note:*  
The final problem statement has not been revealed yet. This repository does **not** contain a working project or implementation.

## Problem Understanding
Improper waste management and delayed reporting of waste hotspots contribute to environmental and public health issues. There is a need for a simple, community-driven mechanism to report and track such issues efficiently.

## Proposed Concept (Preliminary)
We propose a **conceptual solution** where:
- Citizens can report waste hotspots using images and location data
- Reports are visualized on a centralized dashboard
- Authorities can monitor and manage open vs. resolved issues

This concept is **tentative and adaptable**, and will be refined once the final problem statement is disclosed.

## Repository Purpose
- Store preliminary documentation and presentation materials
- Demonstrate problem analysis and ideation skills
- Serve as a base for further development in later rounds

## Status
🟡 **Ideation Phase (No Implementation Yet)**
